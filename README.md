# File organizer and picture processing  

This project is about automating a managing process  

it has one notebook and one python script  

The python scrpit, through the cmd will automatically manage files based on their extension by putting them in the related folder (e.g. "Audio" folder if the extension is .mp3, .wma and so on) if the folder doesn't exist, the script will automatically create it and then move the file, this will be done for audio, text and images files if the file extension is supported    


The notebook has 2 steps:  
1 - Same concept of the python script, but it doesn'r rely on cmd.  
2 - Analyzing some picture and getting some information in a table
